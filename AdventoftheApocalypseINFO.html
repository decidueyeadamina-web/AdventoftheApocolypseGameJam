<h1>Advent of the Apocalypse Game Jam</h1>

<div class="content">
<h4>General Info</h4>
<p align="center">So here’s the lore! A Game Jam is an event for people to come together and make a game on their own or in a group based on a theme under a time limit! This jam will be a twinge different because you can work on your game concept before the event and you’re encouraged to work on game production in that March 7 - March 13 window. You can honestly make any type of game you want as long as it has a general connection to the theme: Advent of the Apocalypse. 
    On March 14 and March 15, the games should be ready to play!</p>

<p align="center">The theme of this game jam is the apocalypse! This can be anything, whether it's a strange disease, random monsters, or the undead disrupting your fictional world’s norm and setting your game into motion! The main idea is for the games we make to be unified by the theme of a disruption from what was the norm, and I think that hits close to home with everyone at CCA right now. 
    I won’t lie, when I found out about CCA closing after the 26-27 school year, it kind of felt like the world was ending. I had plans for the future that involved living here, studying here, and even working here, but all of that exploded in my face with an important email at 8:36am on a random Tuesday. 
    It is indisputable that the shut down and everything surrounding it sucks serious ass, and it’s so easy for anyone to look at this situation and just lose inspiration to create because what’s the fucking point anymore? Which is an excellent question, can’t even lie. But it’s times like this when it’s important to create, to keep going, to connect with the people around us as a community, and to take what we’re feeling right now and make something with it. 
    Because counter question: why let this stop us? Games are meant to create experiences for players, but because we are the ones designing them, we get to make whatever the hell we want–so go as crazy as you want guys :) </p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">~F-ing the A to ur Q's~</h4>
<p style="color: #6fff00;"><strong> What affiliation does this have with CCA? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is a completely student and faculty led project! I had the idea to host a game jam, connected with game art/design faculty. We are using CCA resources game arts resources though!</p>

<p style="color: #6fff00;"><strong> How do I sign up?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sign up with this cool and awesome link here: XX! This form is to get a general idea of how many people are participating, what type of games people are looking to make, and a basic one sentence pitch on the game you’re thinking of! 
    Singing up doesn’t mean you are locked into participating–feel free to email us that you can’t commit to the event anymore if you can’t! </p>
 
<p style="color: #6fff00;"><strong> Is this open for anyone to sign up?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">YES YES YES!!! You can be in any major, any department, and any position (student, staff, faculty, alum, the cat that chills by student services sometimes, idc!) 
    as long as you are part of the CCA community!</p>

<p style="color: #6fff00;"><strong>When does the game jam start?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN!!! But seriously, now is the time to begin planning and pre-production for your game. 
    If you are interested in doing this game ham, then you should definitely look into getting your team together, looking at scheduling/meetings, 
    checking out info sessions and signing up, and beginning to create a design document. </p>

<p style="color: #6fff00; text-align: center;"><strong>What’s the difference between pre-production, production, and publication and also why does that matter for this game jam?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A game jam is basically speed-running the entire game development process, so here’s a basic run down of what that looks like for the event:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Production</strong> - rapid fire concepts and hammering out game mechanics (now until March 7)</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> - making the game and testing it (March 7-March 13)</li>
<li><strong>Publication</strong> - having other people play cool and awesome games (March 14 and 15)</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: #6fff00;"><strong> What types of games can I make?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Anything you can and want!! 2D and 3D video games as well as board games are welcome, especially because most CCA classes have had 
    instruction on how to make those types of games! Any genre can work too as long as there’s a connection to the theme! </p>

<p style="color: #6fff00;"><strong> What game resources can we use for this? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Game Arts Studio Lab 252 has PC’s that already have game engines such as Unreal and Unity as well as more story based game engines such as Twine and RenPy. 
    For 3D modelling, ZBrush is also installed and ready to use in the Game Art Lab, and there is a sound library on the PC’s in Lab 252 as well. 
    Computers in the Game Art Studio also have the Adobe Suite and tablets available in Lab 252 for use, which require a pen to be checked out from the media center 
    for use but still. </p>

<p style="color: #6fff00;"><strong> How do I make a game in a week that sounds kind of insane?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ok so truth nuke, it is a massive undertaking but the goal isn’t to have like a whole massive AAA 684930 hour long game finished, it’s more for setting up 
    a level to a game and polishing that! </p>

<p>I’ll try to update the FAQ’s if there’s more questions I haven’t thought of that roll in! </p>
